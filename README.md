```

## Usage

Let's create simple example:
```js
const { formatSwtf } = require('swtf-fmt');

const rawSwtf = `
- Daily tasks üòê:

    -    store: [borring]
            - food
        - coffee
    - work: [borring]
          - include e2e testing mechanism      [p: high]
        - improve load testing    [p: medium]
    - write today's tasks in SWTF [cool]
`;


console.log(formatSwtf(rawSwtf));
```

Code above will output:
```
- Daily tasks üòê:
    - store: [borring]
        - food
        - coffee
    - work: [borring]
        - include e2e testing mechanism [p: high]
        - improve load testing [p: medium]
    - write today's tasks in SWTF [cool]
```

## Magic attributes (*IN DEVELOPMENT*)

Use magic attributes to boost your experience of writing tasks in SWTF.

Magic attributes are way to enhance SWTF formatting. By default `swtf-fmt` provides set of magic attributes that can help you in managing and organizing your tasklists.

### How magic attributes work?

After parsing `SWTF` input using `swtf-parser` all attributes are going throug all registred `Attribute Magic` instances. `Attribute Magic` is process of handling *special* attribute names or values to enhance your SWTF experience.

List of default magic attributes:

| Value template     | Description | Compiled example |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------- |
| `today`            |             | `26.05.2022.`    |
| `after: {{value}}` |             | `28.05.2022.`    |
